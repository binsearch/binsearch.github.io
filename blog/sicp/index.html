<p>One of my professors told us that If we list all books about computer science in the order of their importance, SICP would be in the top 5. That is a huge claim.
He doesn't usally exaggerate. So, SICP was in my to-read list for a long time. After 3 years I started reading it and right now I'm in the middle of the second chapter.
The first chapter is not that mind-blowing. I was disappointed. Though after reading a part of the second chapter, I am completely sold.
Enough with the praise. Let's get to the details.</p>
<p>In lisp, <code>cons</code> is a way to bind two things together.
For example,</p>
<pre><code>  (cons 2 3) 
</code></pre>
<p>binds <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> together into a pair.
you can then access the individual parts of a pair using</p>
<pre><code>  (car (cons 2 3))
  &gt; 2
  (cdr (cons 2 3))
  &gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>The description of <code>cons</code> suggests that it is a data structure. My feeling before
reading SICP was that data is different from code. Or, a program is divided into data and functions.
What if I want to write my own version of <code>cons</code> in scheme? I couldn't find an
answer to this question. So, I looked it up in SICP. Lo and behold, epicness ensued.</p>
<pre><code>  (define (cons x y)
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((= m 0) x)
            ((= m 1) y)
            (else (error &quot;Argument not 0 or 1 -- CONS&quot; m))))
    dispatch)

  (define (car z) (z 0))
  (define (cdr z) (z 1))
</code></pre>
<p><code>cons</code> can be implemented as a function. A purely functional data structure. WoW. That is something.
Since then, I have decided that I should read this amazing book. What came next is even more awesome.
What if we can implement numbers as functions. The idea itself is mind-boggling.</p>
<pre><code>  (define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
  (define (add-1 n)
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
  (define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))
  (define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x)))))
  (define (plus a b)
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((b f) ((a f) x)))))
  (define (print n)
    ((n inc) 0))
</code></pre>
<p>The basic idea is to implement an integer <code>n</code> as the function  <code>(f (f (f ....(n times) x))..</code>
I checked if my implementation is correct using the <code>print</code> function.</p>
