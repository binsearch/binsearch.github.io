Who?

20-something  Male. Indian. Computer Science graduate. 

Why?

I read a lot of fiction. I have this itch to write. I'm scratching my itch here.

What?

I haven't confined myself to any specific topics. If I have to guess... football, Computer Science, books and some posts on the human condition (to borrow words from DFW and to sound high brow).

I do programming by day. I live in Mumbai, the city that never sleeps.

Love,
`binsearch`.
