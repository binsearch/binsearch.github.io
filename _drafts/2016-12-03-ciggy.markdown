# Cigarette anecdotes

In my first year of college, when I was a young kid just out of intermediate, without even a full grown mustache, I looked down upon people who smoked cigarettes. When I saw someone smoking there was an instant neuron firing telling me that the person doesn't have a life, that he is a bad person, etc.. Fast forward 5 years and I am right now deeply invested in a brawl with my friends regarding who hid our ciggys (cigarettes are affectionately called as ciggys in our circle). Time is a strange thing. Given enough time you won't be able recognize a person. the dx change in character summed up over a long time results in something so drastic that the person is essentially a stranger to you. That's one of the reasons why friendships break if the participants don't see each other for a long time. It's all about integrating that small difference. aah, MA 105. You proved yourself to be useful.

There is this tradition in our circle, wherein a responsible individual (hehe) hides the cigarette packet so that we don't smoke too many ciggys. This was good in the beginning days. It controlled our ciggy intake to some extent, but soon everyone started hiding ciggys, it soon turned into a conspiracy game where in everyone doubted every other person. 'When it came to ciggys, you can't trust anyone' - is our general consensus.
