Here I am looking at this blank screen and anxious about how to start this
post. There. I have started it. uff. A load off my back. "So, what's this
post about?", my imaginary reader asks and I respond, "I don't know. Just 
going with the flow here. Please bear with me" and as he is created out of
my imagination, he obliges. 

In Jan 2016 I dropped out of college. I still got my bachelor's degree, but 
no master's. After that I mucked about in a startup as an intern which didn't
workout. I was too immature and laid back to get accustomed to a 9-5 routine.
Then I went home, stayed with my parents for a couple of months. In June I
joined a startup as a full time employee. It's september now and It has been
three months since I started working here. I am right now in a position where
losing my job in October is a very real possibility. I won't go into the details,
suffice it to say I messed up. I am not even sure I did the wrong thing. There 
is just a real possiblity for my life to go through a big change in the coming
month.
