For the last few years, I spent a lot of my mental bandwidth on figuring out *how to be happy*.
In the beginning, I wasn't very successful in my search. I turned towards self helps books,
started reading '7 habits of highly effective teenagers', books by Norman Vincent Pele[TK] and
all sorts of crazy stuff. The problem with self help books is that

* lots of information
* no backup from science

### Information overload
When you desperately want your life to take a happy turn, you want simple actionable advice. A
small step which would take you in the right direction. The self help books can't stop talking.
They have too much info. They want you do be punctual, honest, blah blah blah. This is not
actionable advice.

### no backup from science
The self help authors rarely back up their advice with research. They play the role of
soothsayers. Predicting you to be happy if you do this. What's the proof? nothing.

In those days, I wasn't as clear headed as I am now. It took me a long time to get out of that self-help
book buying spiral.

After self-help, I started reading about productivity hacks. I constantly read 'lifehacker'. Checking it
out every half an hour. I find out similar sites like 'lifehacker' and started following them. This didn't
last long. I broke down one day and blocked 'lifehacker' on my computer. After that I started reading
about 'minimalism'. I read 'zenhabits', 'theminimalists' and other such sites. I kept my room clean, discarded
all unnecessary items. I even made a wallet out of paper. In hindsight, there was nothing bad with
this 'minimalism' phase. I just lost interest after a few months.
