For the last few years, I spent a lot of my mental bandwidth on figuring out *how to be happy*.
In the beginning, I wasn't very successful in my search. I turned towards self helps books,
started reading '7 habits of highly effective teenagers', books by Norman Vincent Pele[TK] and
all sorts of crazy stuff. The problem with self help books is that they have

* lots of information
* no backup from science

### Information overload
When you desperately want your life to take a happy turn, you want simple actionable advice. A
small step which would take you in the right direction. The self help books can't stop talking.
They have too much info. They want you do be punctual, honest, blah blah blah. This is not
actionable advice.

### no backup from science
The self help authors rarely back up their advice with research. They play the role of
soothsayers. Predicting you to be happy if you do this. What's the proof? nothing.

In those days, I wasn't as clear headed as I am now. It took me a long time to get out of that self-help book buying spiral.

After self-help, I started reading about productivity hacks. I constantly read 'lifehacker'. Checking it every half an hour. I found out similar sites like 'lifehacker' and started following them. This didn't last long. I broke down one day and blocked 'lifehacker' on my computer. After that I started reading about 'minimalism'. I read 'zenhabits', 'theminimalists' and other such sites. I kept my room clean, discarded all unnecessary items. I even made a wallet out of paper. In hindsight, there was nothing wrong with this 'minimalism' phase. I just lost interest after a few months.

Till a few months back, I have been searching like this. Searching for some epiphany, something that will give my direction, that will hit me like a ton of bricks and jolt me awake from this uncertainity.

While exploring my consciousness one day, I had this thought that the amount of happiness you experience in life depends on your habits. not goals. I had this brilliant clarity that if I wanted to be happy, then I should focus more on my habits. Think more about them. On a sunny day, while I was browsing the internet, I stumbled upon the concept of 'keystone habits'. A set of 5-6 habits which when acquired helps you acquire other good habits unconsciously. In other words, A set of 5 habits which guarantee you happiness. BAM. That was the epiphany I had been waiting for all these years.

## What are they?
here is the list of the 5 keystone habits in no particular order

* journal (morning pages)
* meditation
* exercise
* diet (eat healthy)
* budgeting (make a budget and follow it)

I do journalling in the form of 'morning pages'. I write 750 words everyday in the morning with no backspace i.e., no editing. Just do some reflection. the 'morning pages' habit is easy to acquire compared to other habits in the list. eating healthy is complex if you want to count your calories and all, but following a few good heuristics like 'less fast food' will get you far. So, there you have it. The backbone for your existence, for your good life.

The most important part of the puzzle fell into place. Now we need help in forming habits. Anyone trying to develop a gym habit will tell you how hard it is. The key here is to start small. Don't go for a complete overhaul of your lifestyle. If you want to start meditating, just do it for 5 minutes daily. start small. Don't worry about the size of your task. Don't think that 5 minutes of meditation is nothing and you should do more. Be patient. These small tasks will add up over time.
Give it time. It's like filling a tank in a small stream. The progress maybe slow, but given enough time you will have lots of water.
