When my friends told me that we will be going to Pawna lake on the weekend, I was
pretty excited. I don't travel. This was an opportunity to step out of my comfort
zone. When the day finally came, I was filled with fear and I almost dropped out. 

I have been living in Mumbai for 5 years but I have never once visited Lonavala. It may
sound strange but I hated travelling. The rains in Mumbai don't stop once they get
into full flow. On the weekend, It was raining the entire time. 

We started from Mumbai at 8.30 am on saturday. It took us 3 hours
to reach Lonavala. We found a waterfall on a hill and stayed there for a while.
There was a small shop there where we got Egg bhurji and bread. The rain added more
flavor to the Bhurji. Cleaning hands and hygiene went right out the window.
In the afternoon we went to Lonavala town and had lunch. After that we started for
Pawna lake. 

We reached there in the evening, had some fun throwing pebbles into the lake and making
them skip (I am not good at it :)). A few of us pitched tents, while I and a few others
went back to the town to get wood, food and other supplies. By the time we came back, 
It was around 10.30 pm. One of our tents collapsed due to wind. I saw how to pitch a 
tent and how to make a fire. It was fun seeing friends try lighting a fire in rain. 

After the fire was made, we got chairs and sat around it in a circle. We talked and 
drank wine. Slowly everyone retreated to their tents and slept. I tried to sleep too,
but my tent was leaking. This was the only major inconvenience in the entire trip. Lack
of sleep. This could have been avoided if we planned well. 

On sunday morning, the weather was beautiful. The surroundings looked
surreal. We packed everything and went back to Lonavala town. We had 
Our food at a McDonald's. We hitup a few places on our way back too. 
One of our friends knew a trail which leads to the top of a hill. We
started on the trail and reached the peak in about 5 mins. 
It felt like standing on the edge of the world. The spot we were standing
gave a bird's eye view of the entire place. Nature never disappoints.

We stopped at a few more places and started back to Mumbai. After
reaching home, we gave back the cars we rented. I took a hot shower.
After all the rain and being cold for the last couple of days, the
sensation of hot water running down my spine was pure bliss.

I don't wanna say that I did a complete 180 and love travelling now.
I still don't love it, but it's not so bad. A nature trip every month
seems good.
