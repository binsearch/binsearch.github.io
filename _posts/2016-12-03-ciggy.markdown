# Cigarette anecdotes

> disclaimer: This post is fiction. Any resemblances with people living or dead is purely coincidental 

In my first year of college, when I was a young kid just out of intermediate, without even a full grown mustache, I looked down upon people who smoked cigarettes. When I saw someone smoking there was an instant neuron firing telling me that the person doesn't have a life, that he is a bad person, etc.. Fast forward 5 years and I am right now deeply invested in a brawl with my friends regarding who hid our ciggys (cigarettes are affectionately called as ciggys in our circle). Time is a strange thing. Given enough time you won't be able recognize a person. the dx change in character summed up over a long time results in something so drastic that the person is essentially a stranger to you. That's one of the reasons why friendships break if the participants don't see each other for a long time. It's all about integrating that small difference. aah, MA 105. You proved yourself to be useful.
